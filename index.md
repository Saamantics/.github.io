Here are some projects I'm working on:

# My Interests

I'm interested in different topics that satiate my boredom from time to time. But never too deep that it becomes a source of boredom itself. I'm passionate, not obsessed!

# My Vision

What I hope to see in the future despite the use of visual aid

# Interested/ Themes for the year 2021

  My plan is to listen to Schubert and get a good understanding of his orchestral works, his vocal works as well as his early and late period stages.

# Storyline Setting: Hammertown kinda cyber punkish but mechanical.
Similar setting to Hamilton, Ont.
3 components: 
i) The university- high tech hub investing in technology, with emphasis in human cyb, such as health, hands and hearing plus tech
-there's a hangout place there called milforth. Mills-fourth floor throwback
ii) Downtown- sketchy plus industrial which is where the stereotypical cyber punk comes in. Instead of loss of industry, big accident causing many disabled people who need cybernetic enhancements. Lots of steel involved, outfits are very industrial vibez.
iii) The Mountain- where the rich people live, overlooking all of steel town.


points of contention: road down the mountain. Stealing the idea of japanese drifters where they learn to drift in the mountains, what all the rich people up the mountain and the poor people in downtown is the love of speed. rich people ride very fancy nice cars, while downtown rides cars they stole or junk cars that were heavily modded.
Lots of deaths from fights, drifting down the mountain and losing control and falling down the cliffs, etc.

# random thought: 
the Korean word 증 if you think about it then it looks like a pi sign divided by 0. And what's funny is that 증명 means prove in Korean. So like prove pi over 0. 

pant shirts, with the pockets at the chest area

Why can't we have people have autotune on them everytime they talk? like a speaker that looks like a mask that talks in a different tune for them?
Even better, a theremin controlled voice changer. ooh :o.
kinda like the link below but not as stupid sounding:

Nicknames: Samlet, standard deviation- sigma

I care about us- icarus
A video/ photo story about a relationship where one side gives more than the other, bringing them too close to the sun and being burned. Plus there can be the whole symbolism of falling into the sea, aka plenty of fish in the sea
