my plan is to listen to Schubert and get a good understanding of his orchestral works, his vocal works as well as his early and late period stages.

The concept of music representing something usually a story is confounding for me. Like shakespeare used references to explain concepts in a single word, same goes for a song.
It's been done hundreds of years ago, but just the thought of words transforming from the eye to the ear just sounds romantic. This is precisely what Schubert does with his lieds.
Instead of weak, poorly thought out words from myself and contemporary teen cringe love letters and emo music, he hijacks works of a brilliant german poet, Goethe as his subject
to bring life to. I don't know enough about Goethe but many distinguished intellectuals do so I'll take their word for it.
How I want to what I have learned is to be able to explain how I'm feeling with the pieces of music to make communication whole. I.e: a scenario when one is upset I'd say that
I'm Beethoven pastorale symphony IVth mvmt furious. Or better yet, I'd start humming drmdrmdrmdrmdrm.... DUUUUUNNNNN, DUUUUUNNNNN, DUuuN DUN DUN DUN, DUN DUN DUN(the loud part
where the music goes nuts). If that doesn't make sense, consider background music for films. The songs used for the emotional moments of the movie have to fit the tone of the song.
But instead of having the song in the background, make it the focal point. No words, just humming? or a vocalization of the music. Clearly not possible in written but for nowaday
formats, it's possible? Something in the future? Should be fine unless one is deaf or tone deaf.
