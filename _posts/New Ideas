Some weird dream about something being hot and cold

Quotes:
"In burning he was supposed to represent a god. Coming down to earth to play with the lowely humans."

"In the next place the knight will have the power to concentrate the whole result of the operations of thought in one act of consciousness. 
If he lacks this intensity, if his soul from the beginning is dispersed in the multifarious, he will never get time to make the movements, 
he will be constantly running errands in life, never enter into eternity,
for even at the instant when he is closest to it he will suddenly discover that he has forgotten something for which he must go back.
- Fear and Trembling, Soren Kierkegaard
