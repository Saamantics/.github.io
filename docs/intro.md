### Motivation: 
So this is my last semester in university.
I currently hate myself because I haven't done anything
I have 5 courses and 0 job but still did so bad on my courses. I can compare myself to someone else who may not have the same opportunity as I do
but I don't give a fuck about them at all. What's important to me is only myself yet it doesn't seem like I have done anything to improve myself.
I need motivation and a drive for doing things and need to commit so that I don't give up and turn to other things.
Let this be the start to things and attain some goals for myself, especially with all the new years bullshit.

1.Understand how to use github better to put files in this website.
2.Increase my understanding of R, by using the repositories here
3.Be unfiltered in what I say here, even though it is public, if you can't say it here, then don't say it at all.
Get job ready soon.
4. Complete some projects in R
5. Post course notes for my classes in here, so that I don't have to keep going back and forth.
Also if you have some clever ideas, put them here too.
6. Fuck this, also fuck school. What I've learned from my time in university is that everything related to math can be learned from books and online.
the only reason why we go to school is for lectures and for getting shit marked. Another huge aspect of this is motivation.
Unfortunately I am a lazy poc, so that even when I try to do something and get graded for something I'm paying for I don't do it.
So in order to push myself to be better, I will use this as a platform to learn cuz I don't need school, just proper motivation and a good
textbook.
so let this day, Dec. 27, 2018 be the start of this. Let's come back and see how much this has grown or how much I haven't done shit by Dec 27, 2019.
